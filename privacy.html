    </ul>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect and Visibility</h2>
    <p>We collect information to operate our marketplace, secure your account, and allow you to connect with other users. <strong>The provision of Account Data (Email, Username, Password) is a mandatory contractual requirement;</strong> failure to provide it makes it impossible to create an account.</p>

        <li><strong>Basic Profile (Mandatory):</strong> Username.</li>
        <li><strong>Seller Content (Mandatory only if you choose to list items):</strong> Product listings (including, but not limited to, images, titles, descriptions, prices, and condition) and your designated selling location/currency.</li>
